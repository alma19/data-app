### MEJO 586: Interactive Multimedia. PROJECT 3: Data App.

#### Project Description: 

Using any data set from data.gov, create a data driven dashboard that accurately tells a story or shows breakdowns and collections of the data in a visual way. This dashboard should be a well designed web application that is interactive and visual. Whenever possible, data should link to outside sources.

#### Requirements:

+ Responsive Design (Bootstrap3)
+ Styles must follow one of the style guides linked below.
+ Use of Charts and Graphs (Suggest C3.js, or HighCharts highcharts.com/))
+ Featured Tabular Display of a subset of data (Top 10, Specific tag, or date)
+ Tabular Display of ALL data (suggest datatables.net/))
+ Use of strong UI elements, (tabs, accordion, sliders, overlays, etc.)
+ Use of XML Data from data.gov


#### Expectations:

This site/app should professional and work well enough to publish on NYTimes or Washington Post when you turn it in. It will use their style guide so it better be good!

33% of the grade will be the working code and how you implemented it, 33% will be the design and how well it looks and %33% will be the storytelling and presentation of data.
